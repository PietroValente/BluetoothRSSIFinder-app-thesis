## Overview

It works in two screens: in the first, the user must select the device for which he wants to know the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from a list of devices. In the second, when the "SEARCH" button is pressed, the values received from the previously selected device are recorded, at a low level each time a new value is found the search is stopped and another is created. This procedure continues until the user presses "STOP", at this point the data found are automatically saved in an excel file in memory (Misurazioni.xls)
